# Koumu å‘†

*Koumu is a simple program that doubles as commit message validator (installed as Git hooks) and as
a CLI utility allowing you to interactively write valid commit messages.*

## How to use

### Installing

Koumu being an NPM package, the recommended way to install it is via NPM. Make sure you have it
installed and run:

```
npm install -g koumu
```

Then if you already configured your `$PATH` to include NPM's global installation directory, you
should be able to just run `koumu --help` in your terminal to get started.

If you didn't configure your `$PATH` and running `koumu --help` results in `command not found`,
you can add the following line at the end of your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc`,
`~/.zshrc`, ... depending on your shell):

```bash
export PATH="$(npm prefix -g)/bin:$PATH"
```

### Setting up the hooks

Koumu's cli includes a `setup` command to help you configure your repository to use Koumu's Git
hook. It can either simply write the hooks files under `.git/hooks` or, if your repository is a JS
project that uses NPM or Yarn, Koumu can also setup [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for
you; an NPM package that allows committing hooks and automatically installing them when running
`npm/yarn install`.

#### Setup Koumu for any Git repository

If your project isn't a JS project, if your package manager isn't supported, or if you do not wish
to use Husky, you can still easily install the hook on any Git repository by running:

```
koumu setup --git
```

This will simply write the hooks under `.git/hooks/`.

#### Setup Koumu and Husky for a JS project

If you're using Yarn 2, run the following command:

```
koumu setup --yarn2
```

If you're using Yarn 1 or NPM, run this one:

```
koumu setup --npm
```

This will edit your `package.json` in order to install Husky and instruct it how to automatically
install Koumu's hooks. To finish the installation, run the `install` command of your package
manager (`yarn install` or `npm install`).

### Using the interactive prompt

When you're ready to commit, simply run:

```
koumu commit
```

An interactive prompt will run, assisting you in writing a commit message respecting your rules.

### Defining your rules

Koumu reads a configuration file `.koumurc.toml` that should be at the root of your project. You
can also create a configuration file that will be defaulted to if the current project doesn't have
one in:

- `$HOME/.koumurc.toml`
- On GNU/Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/koumu/koumurc.toml`
- On MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Preferences/koumu/koumurc.toml`

You can either create it manually by copying the example configuration from the section below or
you can use the following command to write it at the specified path:

```bash
koumu write-config "$HOME/.koumurc.toml"
```

#### Example configuration

```toml
mergeKind = ":twisted_rightwards_arrows:"

maxCommitLength = 72

# Comment the following to disable scopes
[scopes]
meta = "Anything about the project"
docs = "Documentation"

[kinds]
":sparkles:" = "implement a new feature"
":zap:" = "update existing feature"
":recycle:" = "refactor code"
":racehorse:" = "improve performance"
":bug:" = "fix a bug"
":rotating_light:" = "critical hotfix"
":warning:" = "fix compiler / linter warnings"
```
